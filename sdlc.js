// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step where developers determine what steps, resources, and items will be required to successfully implement the initial design. They figure out what this new software needs to do"

const design = "This is the third step where a model or a prototype of the initial idea is materialized. This step includes determining crucial elements such as user and system interfaces, databases, and network requirements."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step is essentially where you code things out."

const testingAndIntegrating = "This is the 5th step where they try to break the code and locate all of the bugs before the softare goes live."

const maintain = "This is the last step where you get updates and checks into the security because there are always new updates, bugs, and security threats coming into the system."
